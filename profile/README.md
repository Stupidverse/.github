## About Us

Stupidverse originally started as an idea we had to make a Miiverse revival using exclusively ChatGPT's code; however, it has evolved into so much more! We went from some stupid joke to actually trying to develop something! This is our first web development project, so don't expect it to be perfect, but we're giving it our best shot!

## Our Goals

We currently have a pretty simple list of goals, but they might be challenging considering we don't have much experience, but we all start somewhere!

1. Communities for Wii U, 3DS, and Switch.
2. Posting in communities.
3. Admin Panel
   - Allow banning users from the panel.
   - Allow verifying users from the panel (gives the Miiverse check but with a pink recolor).
   - Allow muting users from the panel.
   - Verified users are mods.
4. Allow mods to moderate the communities.
   - Allow mods to delete posts from a drop-down on every post.
5. Allow users to delete their own posts.
   - Assign every post a post ID, and when the post is clicked, it takes you to /community-name/posts/postid.
6. Assign every account a user ID, and when their Mii (profile picture) or name is clicked, it takes you to /userid.
7. Add the Wii U Miiverse nav-bar.
8. Make it look similar to the Wii U's Miiverse (3DS isn't much of a priority).
9. Add account creation.
   - After an account is made, the user must make a Mii that will be used on the nav bar for the user icon and their profile picture.
10. Yeahing Posts.
11. Reposting feature similar to Twitter (X).
12. Add a private messaging system and notifications.

## What about Juxtaposition? (Pretendo Networks Miiverse revival)

Pretendo is a completely separate service, and while we respect their work, this is mostly being done because we don't like the UI, lol!

## How can I help?
The Stupidverse-Site repository holds all the code for the Portal UI (and later on ctr and off-device)! Currently off-device and ctr are not being worked on however if you want to start it you can!
